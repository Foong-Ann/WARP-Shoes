For the course culminating project in MIE262: Deterministic Operations Research, my team and I were tasked with developing the most profitable production plan, considering the constraints given by the WARP Shoe Company- which is one of the oldest shoe companies in Canada.

At the beginning of year 2006, one of the major market competitors of WARP went bankrupt. Thus,  WARP market analysts predict that for the month of February the demand for all types of shoes will double.  It is assumed that the closing inventory of January 2006 was zero for all types of shoes, and that all sales happen at the end of the month.
